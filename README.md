RNAdesign
=========

The RNAdesign program solves the multi-target RNA sequence design problem. You
can give one or more structural targets for which a single compatible sequence
is designed.

HOW TO USE RNAdesign
====================

RNAdesign designs RNA sequences given one or more structural targets. The
program offers a variety of optimization functions that each can be used to
optimize candidate sequence towards a certain goal, say, minimal ensemble
defect or small energetic distance to another target structure.


RNAdesign input
---------------

Structural targets are given via stdin, preferably via an input file. Below is
a the small tri-stable from our paper, which you should then pipe to RNAdesign:
"echo tri-stable.dat | RNAdesign"

"cat tri-stable.dat:"

 # a tri-stable example target.
 ((((....))))....((((....))))........
 ........((((....((((....))))....))))
 ((((((((....))))((((....))))....))))
 # below follows a trivial (and optional) sequence constraint.
 NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN

The input may contain many comments lines, starting with a hash "#" and at most
one sequence constraint line. All of these lines are optional, except of course
for the structural constraints.


Optimization functions
----------------------

Depending on the actual design you are looking for, you'll want to modify the
optimization function. Below, the different options available are detailed. By
giving a complex "--optfun", many different design goals can be tried.

A good optimization goal is (as an example for three targets):

--optfun "eos(1)+eos(2)+eos(3) - 3 * gibbs + 1 * ((eos(1)-eos(2))^2 + (eos(1)-eos(3))^2 + (eos(2)-eos(3))^2)"

This way, the sequence produces close-to-mfe foldings with the targets (left)
and the targets are close together in terms of energy. (1 * ) scales the two
terms according to user choice.

### binary, combining:

+ - * /  :: the four basic operations
^        :: (^) generalized power function

### binary, apply function to many targets:

sum max min   :: run function over set of targets: sum(eos,1,2) or sum(eos,all)

### unary, apply to single target:

eos      :: energy of a structure: eos(1)
ed       :: ensemble defect of a structure: ed(3)

### nullary, constant for the current sequence:

Ged      :: global, weighted ensemble defect: Ged
gibbs    :: gibbs free energy of sequence
mfe      :: minimum free energy of sequence

### special:

logMN    :: requires four parameters logMN(0.2,0.3,0.3,0.2) penalizes according to given mono-nucleotide distribution in order of ACGU
